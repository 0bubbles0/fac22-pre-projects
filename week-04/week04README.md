### Research
- [x] **CSS Architecture**
  - [x] Guidelines: <https://cssguidelin.es/>
  - [x] BEM: <http://getbem.com/introduction/>
  - [x] Composition: <https://every-layout.dev/rudiments/composition/>
  - Questions:
    - Why are CSS naming conventions useful? 
      - Structure, Speed, Reusable &rarr; BEM (`.button__state--danger {}`)
    - When might specificity become a problem? 
      - Inconsistency, Later adjustment, collaboration, large projects
    - How can composition help us build UIs?
      - consistent layout system, component-based UI, (`.box-m {}`), primitive/reusable/responsive classes (e.g. space children vertically)

- [x] **Responsive Design**
  - [x] Units: <https://every-layout.dev/rudiments/units/>
  - [x] length: <https://css-tricks.com/the-lengths-of-css/>
  - [x] mobile-first: <https://zellwk.com/blog/how-to-write-mobile-first-css/>
  - Questions:
    - What CSS units should we use for dimensions? What are absolute and relative units?
      - rem (block elements), em (inline elements), ch (max-width), vw & vh (responsive spacing), vmin & vmax (find true screen size), % (based on parent)
    - When should you use a media query? Are they only for screen size?
      - mobile (min) or desktop (max) first or combination. Can make hard break
      - Others: `@media not|only mediatype[all/print/screen/speech] and (expressions, size, orientation:landscape) { }`
    - How can mobile-first CSS make responsive styling easier?
      - defaults often work fine on mobiles

- [ ] **Advanced CSS**
  - [ ] selectors: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors>
  - [ ] pseudo elements: <https://css-tricks.com/pseudo-element-roundup/>
  - [ ] underenginerr radio: <https://adrianroselli.com/2017/05/under-engineered-custom-radio-buttons-and-checkboxen.html>
  - Questions:
    - What are “combinator” selectors? Can you provide examples where they’re useful?
    - What are pseudo-elements? Can you provide examples where they’re useful?
    - How might you create custom-styled checkboxes using both of the above?
