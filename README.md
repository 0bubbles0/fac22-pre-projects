# Pre-apprenticeship Display and Workspace

## Founders and Coders Cohort 22 (June - September 2021)

This repository is hosted on <https://0bubbles0.github.io/fac22-pre-projects/>.

It is my display and working area for the fac22 pre-apprenticeship material.

### Contents

#### Weekly Folders

- **Planning**: tasks, to-do lists
- **Notes**: from sessions and own research
- **Workshops**: solutions and documentation of the process
- **Projects**: solutions, process documentation, variation ideas

#### Project Gallery Page (index.html)

- **Content**:
  - A gallery of the projects I have worked on, both guided tutorials (projects and workshops), and original partner sprints
  - Link to my personal introduction page (on `<bubbles>` logo)
  - Link to Glossary Page

#### Glossary Page (glossary.html)

- **Content**:
  - A collection of my documentations and notes, sorted by topic for quick reference access

#### Style and Scripts of the Gallery and Glossary Pages

These two pages are my trial and error tests of new concepts I have learned. I'm constantly trying out different styles and scripts, so that I can get a practical idea of why certain ways have become best practices. It also gives me an opportunity to try an alternative approach to components I have built before, so that I can find out which way works best. I have noticed that this approach has a more lasting impact on my learning, as I actually spend some time trying out a path rather than just reading about it or seeing a short code example.

Currently, I'm trying:

- Alternative ways to build a **sticky top navbar** on my Gallery Page: grid or `position: fixed`?
- The respective advantages of different **CSS naming approaches**: BEM and/or Composition?
- Applying the JS30 **Flex Panels** to organise my Glossary Page:
  - On expand, a panel and its font size should grow bigger
  - On second click, the panel and font should shrink back to its original

If you can spot bugs on these trial and error missions before I do, would you like to raise it as an Issue?

### Template Repo

Create a new repository on your own profile which has a README.md and a set of folders for each week.

How you lay out this repository and how the site looks are up to you. We've added a couple of files already so you can see how we suggest laying out the learnings from each week. If you'd rather structure the repository differently, you're welcome to.

You might like to host this repository on GitHub pages and contain your project sites inside this single repository.

You might prefer to create each site in its own repository and link to them from this central directory.
