## Research Spikes (90 min)

### JS Debugging

- [x] Console: <https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-the-most-out-of-the-javascript-console-b57ca9db3e6d/>
- [x] Debugging Chrome DevTools: <https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/>

- How would you effectively find out where (and why) an error is occurring in your JavaScript code?
- What console methods are there other than console.log? Can these help us debug?
- What does the debugger; statement do?
- How do we use the debugger in our browser?

### JS Async

- [x] Async concepts: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Concepts>

- How does JS handle asynchronous code?
- What’s the difference between “synchronous” and “asynchronous” code? Why might synchronous code be called “blocking”?
